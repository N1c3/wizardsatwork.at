              The MagicShifter 3000, the latest and most advanced addition to the MagicShifter series, 
              is an open source hardware gadget for RGB lighting, gaming and POV (persistence of vision) applications.
            p Using it's accelerometer and 16 bright RGB LEDs you can draw images “into thin air”.
            p It’s only 103x27x13mm so it fits in every pocket.

          .description
            p EvoCell is a game engine based on the evolutionary cycles of cellular automata.
            p This allows us to simulate a world of constant change through evolution and interaction of it's smallest parts, the pixels.
            p Using mathemagics, every pixel in our games is conjured as a consciousness which bases decisions on it's surroundings.
            p Multiple pixels can band together and become a multi-pixel life form, which then again, has awareness of it's environment.

          h3 HexPaper
          .description
            p We originally created this notebook blocks since a lot of our work on evocell involves hex grids.
            p Some of our friends started to use them for their artistic work.
            p When our role playing groups started using the block to draw maps we realized, that there is a small, but dedicated, market for this kind of product.
            p Now you can get your own HexPaper too.
